# SCX Control Plane (v1 draft)

SCX defines the **control authority** that maps inert binary into actionable,
semantic behavior across runtimes. Binary stores bits; SCX provides the rules
that turn those bits into meaning, relationships, and execution.

## Core Domains

* **Geometric control**: spatial state, coordinates, vectors, transforms.
* **Graph/topology control**: relationships, edges, flows, causality.
* **Tensor/field control**: dimensional semantics for weights and models.
* **Execution authority**: triggers for actions and agent behavior.

## Conceptual Stack

| Layer                    | Role                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Binary                   | Inert data substrate  |
| Memory                   | Structured binary     |
| **SCX**                  | **Causal controller** |
| ASX/Blocks               | Macro composition     |
| Runtime (ASXR/Mx2LM)     | System organism       |

## Definition

SCX is a **semantic execution control layer** that maps raw data into geometric,
topological, and behavioral meaning across runtimes.
