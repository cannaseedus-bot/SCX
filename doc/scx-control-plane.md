# SCX Control Plane (v1 draft)

SCX defines the **control authority** that maps inert binary into actionable,
semantic behavior across runtimes. Binary stores bits; SCX provides the rules
that turn those bits into meaning, relationships, and execution. It is not a
storage format; it is the behavior layer that tells the substrate what to do.

## Core Domains

* **Geometric control**: spatial state, coordinates, vectors, transforms.
* **Graph/topology control**: relationships, edges, flows, causality.
* **Tensor/field control**: dimensional semantics for weights and models.
* **Agent control**: intents, roles, and behavioral authority for actors.
* **UI control**: projection bindings for views, panels, and layout.
* **Execution authority**: triggers for actions, events, and state mutation.

| Layer                    | Role                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Binary                   | Inert data substrate  |
| Memory                   | Structured binary     |
| **SCX**                  | **Causal controller** |
| ASX/Blocks               | Macro composition     |
| Runtime (ASXR/Mx2LM)     | System organism       |

## Definition

SCX is a **semantic execution control layer** that maps raw data into geometric,
topological, and behavioral meaning across runtimes. In short: **binary is
matter; SCX is physics**.
